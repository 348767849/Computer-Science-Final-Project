# Computer-Science-Final-Project

Project name: Mall of Gruuty: Monzies

The purpose of this project is to make a wave based survival game with characters from the hit movies: Despicable Me

By mid June, I plan to have basic classes to select to play the game, a wave based system, functional attacking and coop playability, and a basic shop so that I can get paid robux 

I will be using Roblox Studios using Lua to make the game
